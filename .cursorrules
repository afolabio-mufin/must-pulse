# MUST AI Pulse - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
Flutter web app: AI Readiness & Productivity Intelligence Platform for MUST Company.
Aligns with strategic goals: VGTA metrics, AI adoption, prompt dissemination.

## Architecture
- **Clean feature-based structure**: Each feature in its own directory (landing, dashboard, assessment, etc.)
- **Core layer**: Shared theme, constants, models, utils
- **Shared widgets**: Reusable components (StatCard, etc.)
- **Routing**: go_router with path-based URLs for web

## Code Style
- Use `plusJakartaSans` via Google Fonts for typography
- Dark theme: bgDark (#0C1222), bgCard (#151D2E), primary (#0EA5E9)
- Chart colors from AppTheme.chartColors
- Responsive: LayoutBuilder for adaptive grids, respect maxWidth

## Conventions
- Feature pages: StatelessWidget unless state needed
- Mock data in core/utils/mock_data.dart
- All routes defined in main.dart
- Use AppTheme constants for colors, never hardcode

## Agent Architecture Notes (for CPO review)
- **Code Planning**: Feature-first structure; each screen is self-contained
- **SRE/Debug**: Clear separation of concerns; models in core/models
- **Extensibility**: Add backend by replacing MockData with repository pattern
- **Deployment**: Flutter web → build/web; Firebase Hosting or Vercel ready
